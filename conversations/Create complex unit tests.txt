Generate JUNIT 5 unit tests:
public class Player {

    public String name;
    public int age;
    public int experience;
    public List<Integer> skills;

    //Getters
    //Setters
}

public class PlayerAnalyzer {

    public double calculateScore(List<Player> players) {
        double score = 0;

        for (Player player : players) {
            double skillsAverage = player.getSkills().stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum() / (double) player.getSkills().size();
            double contribution = player.getAge() * player.getExperience() * skillsAverage;

            if (player.getAge() < 18) {
                contribution *= 0.5;
            }

            if (player.getExperience() > 10) {
                contribution *= 1.2;
            }

            score += contribution;
        }

        return score;
    }
}

Positive Test Cases:
Case 1: Normal Player
Given an array with a single player object with age 25, experience 5 years, and skills [2, 2, 2], the function should return a score of 250 (since 2552 = 250).
Case 2: Junior Player
Given an array with a single player object with age 15, experience 3 years, and skills [3, 3, 3], the function should return a score of 67.5 (since (1533) *0.5 = 67.5).
Case 3: Senior Player
Given an array with a single player object with age 35, experience 15 years, and skills [4, 4, 4], the function should return a score of 2520 (since (35154) *1.2 = 2520).
Case 4: Multiple Players
Given an array with multiple player objects, the function should return the sum of their scores.
Negative Test Cases:
Case 1: Skills is null.
Given an array with a player where Skills property is null, the function should throw an error.
Case 2: Empty Array
Given an empty array, the function should return 0 (since there are no players to contribute to the score).

To create unit tests for the PlayerAnalyzer class, we can use the org.junit.jupiter.api package provided by JUnit 5.

Here is the code for the tests:

java
Copy code
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class PlayerAnalyzerTest {

    private PlayerAnalyzer analyzer;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        analyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
    }

    @Test
    public void testNormalPlayer() {
        Player player = new Player();
        player.setAge(25);
        player.setExperience(5);
        player.setSkills(Arrays.asList(2, 2, 2));

        double score = analyzer.calculateScore(Collections.singletonList(player));

        assertEquals(250.0, score, "Expected score for normal player does not match");
    }

    @Test
    public void testJuniorPlayer() {
        Player player = new Player();
        player.setAge(15);
        player.setExperience(3);
        player.setSkills(Arrays.asList(3, 3, 3));

        double score = analyzer.calculateScore(Collections.singletonList(player));

        assertEquals(67.5, score, "Expected score for junior player does not match");
    }

    @Test
    public void testSeniorPlayer() {
        Player player = new Player();
        player.setAge(35);
        player.setExperience(15);
        player.setSkills(Arrays.asList(4, 4, 4));

        double score = analyzer.calculateScore(Collections.singletonList(player));

        assertEquals(2520.0, score, "Expected score for senior player does not match");
    }

    @Test
    public void testMultiplePlayers() {
        Player normalPlayer = new Player();
        normalPlayer.setAge(25);
        normalPlayer.setExperience(5);
        normalPlayer.setSkills(Arrays.asList(2, 2, 2));

        Player juniorPlayer = new Player();
        juniorPlayer.setAge(15);
        juniorPlayer.setExperience(3);
        juniorPlayer.setSkills(Arrays.asList(3, 3, 3));

        double score = analyzer.calculateScore(Arrays.asList(normalPlayer, juniorPlayer));

        assertEquals(317.5, score, "Expected score for multiple players does not match");
    }

    @Test
    public void testSkillsIsNull() {
        Player player = new Player();
        player.setAge(25);
        player.setExperience(5);
        player.setSkills(null);

        assertThrows(NullPointerException.class, () -> {
            analyzer.calculateScore(Collections.singletonList(player));
        }, "Expected NullPointerException when skills is null");
    }

    @Test
    public void testEmptyArray() {
        List<Player> emptyList = Collections.emptyList();

        double score = analyzer.calculateScore(emptyList);

        assertEquals(0.0, score, "Expected score for an empty list of players to be 0");
    }
}
Note:

In the above tests, I am assuming that the Player class contains appropriate setters for its attributes.
The testSkillsIsNull test is expecting a NullPointerException because, based on the provided code, calling getSkills() when skills is set to null would result in this exception. If you want to handle such cases more gracefully, you'd have to modify the calculateScore method to check for null values and then adjust the test accordingly.
